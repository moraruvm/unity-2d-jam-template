# 2D Project bootstrap

## Added
* placeholder shape sprites
* dummy GameController
* .gitignore

## Planning to add
* Main Menu scene, easy to skin 
    * fullscreen UI canvas
    * 1 button which loads the game scene
    * social links
    * instructions menu + navigation
* reusable game restart functionality
* free fonts ready to use (at least one pixel font)
* placeholder sounds (8bit samples)
* placeholder particle effect samples (various motions/usages, just replace textures)

## Ideas
* ready to use hex/square tilemaps (just replace tile sprites)
