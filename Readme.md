# 2D Project bootstrap
Personal repo used to fork repos for game jams or rapid prototyping.

## Added
* placeholder shape sprites
* dummy GameController
* .gitignore

## Credits
* silly placeholder sprites https://ninjikin.itch.io/silly-placeholders

## Planning to add
* Main Menu scene, easy to skin 
    * fullscreen UI canvas
    * 1 button which loads the game scene
    * social links
    * instructions menu + navigation
* reusable game restart functionality
* free fonts ready to use (at least one pixel font)
* placeholder sounds (8bit samples)
* placeholder particle effect samples (various motions/usages, just replace textures)

## Ideas
* ready to use hex/square tilemaps (just replace tile sprites)
